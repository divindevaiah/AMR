The submission is incomplete:

- Behaviors description is missing.

- The proportionality factors are used in a way it is hard to set up the vehicle, it could have been explained in the behaiors description. In current setup type C is impossible to distinguish. Pure type A or B would only work if the factor 1 and 2 are equal, otherwise it is behaves assymetrically. The same factor should have been used for both wheels in types A and B and two different factors for type C. This could have been explained in the behaviors.md 

- wheel_diameter parameter is not used in the twist calculation. Yes, this doesn't change the behavior for BV, but it is necessery for the job the *diffirential\_drive\_emulator* does: it should provide correct mapping of the wheel speeds to the robot movement. 

- No tag in the repository, no time report. Please follow the submission rules, otherwise your submissions would not be considered.
