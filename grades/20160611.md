Great job, almost everything works as supposed!

The normalization of the occupancy values is wrong. It is not possible know occupied_sum before all the cone cells are iterated, therefore there is needed another iteration over the cone for the normalization pass.

There some code that seems redundant and not used:

```
            """Convert the distance in map coordinates to a distance in cell coordinates"""
            m_distance_x = m_sonar_x + distance*math.cos(sonar_theta)
            m_distance_y = m_sonar_y + distance*math.sin(sonar_theta)
            m_pos = (m_distance_x,m_distance_y)

            #rospy.loginfo("m_pos")
            #rospy.loginfo(m_pos)

            if not self._convert_to_cell(m_pos):
                pass
                #rospy.loginfo("None")
            else:
                c_distance_x, c_distance_y = self._convert_to_cell(m_pos)
                #rospy.loginfo("cell")
                #rospy.loginfo(c_distance_x)
                #rospy.loginfo(c_distance_y)

            c_distance = self.euclidian_distance(c_sonar_x, c_sonar_y, c_distance_x, c_distance_y)
            """Create the main Cone Object for sonar readings"""

```
